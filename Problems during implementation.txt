First problem we ran into was when trying to convert the program to Android we decided to use
a touchStarted() function, which for some reason made it so that the mouseX and mouseY wasn't
updated correctly.

Since many devices can vary in resolution, the buttons wouldn't work on anything other than
the original device, so we created a way to scale by resolution so that it would work for
any resolution.

The animation is quite simple, but at the start it would jitter when the edge of the window
was hit, because the x and y value for the image could for one frame be more than the width
and height of the screen, this was resolved by adding a way to check if for the next frame
the x and y value of the image would be more than the width and height of the window.
Equation looks like this: animX > width-(animSpeedX*resScaleX)
