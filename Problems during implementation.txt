First problem we ran into was when trying to convert the program to Android we decided to use
a touchStarted() function, which for some reason made it so that the mouseX and mouseY wasn't
updated correctly.

Since many devices can vary in resolution, the buttons wouldn't work on anything other than
the original device, so we created a way to scale by resolution so that it would work for
any resolution.

The animation is quite simple, but at the start it would jitter when the edge of the window
was hit, because the x and y value for the image could for one frame be more than the width
and height of the screen, this was resolved by adding a way to check if for the next frame
the x and y value of the image would be more than the width and height of the window.
Equation looks like this: animX > width-(animSpeedX*resScaleX)

3D model in Processing Android
So..it looks like the 3D model just won't work on a tablet properly. We get around 5-6 fps when we load in the model with textures or even with just materials. We feel terrible. All this work...and to what end?! For nothing! I despise myself.
Right now we will still try a few methods to fix this, but according to our research, Processing Android just can't handle 3D models.
We might just have to run the whole project on computers after all....'
I cant believe this. We resolved the3 problem. It was the motherfucking UV mappings in Maya. We are so happy right now.
